From Decemeber 2022...

This is a program which allow users to create and remove joints with additional functionality for basic keyframing.
Joint configurations can be saved and loaded (model.txt) and .obj files can be snapped onto the joints themselves.
This project was done in Visual Studio 2019 using the [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) library.
